# Sizy

Sizy is a small cross-platform application that helps you get a quick
estimation of the file space usage.

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: : this is an alpha-grade work-in-progress project.
I plan to add a graphical user interface (similar to Gnome Disk Usage Analyzer)
or a ncurses-like command line menu to browse folders (similar to Ranger file
manager). Feel free to reach out and open issues or prepare PR if you want to
contribute. :nerd_face:
